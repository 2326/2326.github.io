                        it's also incredibly satisfying, challenging and overwhelming at the same time. It took me several months to convince my wife
                        to sign up, or let me sign her up, as you ]

Running is obviously a necessary requirement and you need to be relatively fit, but generally if you can run a 10k you'll be fine with the distance on a TM]

                            [Heading into this, literally, I thought it was straightward enough, in, under, out asap, but as soon as you hit the water it's so cold that your body stops responding to your thoughts]

                            [As an added bonus, if your time-slot for starting is late in the day, you'll also get to contend with the sweat and dirt from several thousand people who've plunged in before you, so keep your mouth shut when your in the water!

But I'm not talking about mud you get from walking the dog when its a bit drizzly outside; in parts it is proper clay mud that you're going to battle through. If you stop, you're stuck. At one point, I had stopped to help dig out a teammate and in the process found myslef knee deep in the stop that took a further 5mins to dig out, with some help from my teammates and complete strangers.

                             Then it's waist high liquid dirt If you stop moving for a minute your going to sink in, and I had a real moment of genuine panic after I had stopped to help dig out one of my teammates - I we had been digging out her feet but as we were doing that I got myself wedged in and it took another 5 mins to dig me out.]

                            [So this one is just a straight forward physical challenge where you need to scale over 12ft walls. Even with the help of your teammates it's not simple to get over, and it was significant for me because it was the only obstacle I couldnt do on my first TM, so I dedicated plenty of time in training for my second one to make sure I could do it.]

                            [One of the great things about the TM challenge is that it requires very little equipment to actually train for. My 'berlin walls' training consisted mainly of pulling myself up into my loft, and if I'd randomly find if I was out on a training run I'd pass a bus stop, have a look around and think 'there's no-one about, I'm going to see if I can climb up there!]
